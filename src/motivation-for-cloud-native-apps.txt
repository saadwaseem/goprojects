HyperScale - Traffic Data Features
Antifragility - Clound apps dont break as a whole 
continous delivery and devops 
Opex Savings - automation and utilizations 
3 key principles associated with cloud native applications 
1- Build and compose as microservice
2- Packaged and distributed in containers
3- Dynamically executed in the cloud 

Challenges and Design Principles 

Design for performance

Design for delivery
Design for dianosibility

Components All along the software lifecycle
1- Design
2- Build
3- Run 

Run has various components called ops component
